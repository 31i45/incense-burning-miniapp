# incense-burning-miniapp  
Developing a WeChat Mini Program with AI assistance  


## AI Tools Utilized in This Project:  
1. ~~**Tencent Dev Cloud AI Builder**~~ (deprecated due to poor performance and inefficiency)  
    - Proved highly inefficient, consuming significant time and failing to meet expectations.
2. **VS Code Copilot**  
   - Key contribution: Assisted in completing `incense-burning.html` for the initial project stage.  
3. **Trea CN**  
   - Function: Converted `incense-burning.html` into the folder structure and files required for a WeChat Mini Program.  
4. **Doubao**  
   - Valuable support throughout the development process.  


## Important Notes:  
- Working with code assistants requires strategic approaches and critical thinking.  
- If an AI tool underperforms, project challenges may stem from the tool itself rather than user error.  


## Project Roadmap:  
1. Registered on the WeChat Mini Program platform.  
2. Downloaded the development toolkit to simulate and test the mini program.  
3. Planned for final publication.  


## Repository Usage  
Feel free to use this repository. Note that while the project is functional, it was partially generated with AI assistance.
